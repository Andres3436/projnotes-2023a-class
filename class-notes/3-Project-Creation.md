## Introduction
The Backend is the part of the applications that the user perceives only when It does not work.
A directory website is a website that lists products and services for you to browse.

4.	Choosing the Plugin to Build Your Directory Website.

## Methods
To access the Root Directory, in this step we click on Settings, where a Build & Deploy header appears, in this menu, Root Directory appears and other tabs such as Branch, Build Filters, etc., in which we can configure each of they.

## Results
After having finished the configurations, we go up and left CLICK on MANUAL DEPLOY.

At this stage of the project, the details to configure each of the Settings concept tabs is very important, since it depends on that that the page that is being created is shown without errors.
